                 Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC
            draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence-01

Abstract

   This document describes a technique to generate a signed DNS response
   on demand for a non-existent name by claiming that the name exists
   but doesn't have any data for the queried record type.  Such answers
   require only one minimal NSEC record, allow online signing servers to
   minimize signing operations and response sizes, and prevent zone
   content disclosure.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   One of the functions of the Domain Name System Security Extensions
   (DNSSEC) [RFC9364] is "Authenticated Denial of Existence", i.e.
   proving that a DNS name or record type does not exist.  Normally,
   this is done by means of signed NSEC or NSEC3 records.  In the
   precomputed signature model, these records chain together existing
   names, or cryptographic hashes of them in the zone.  In the online
   signing model, described in NSEC and NSEC3 "White Lies" [RFC4470]
   [RFC7129], they are used to dynamically compute an epsilon function
   around the queried name.  A 'type bitmap' in the data field of the
   NSEC or NSEC3 record asserts which resource record types are present
   at the name.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC     October 2023


   The response for a non-existent name requires up to 2 signed NSEC
   records or up to 3 signed NSEC3 records (and for online signers, the
   associated cryptographic computation), to prove that (1) the name did
   not explicitly exist in the zone, and (2) that it could not have been
   synthesized by a wildcard.

   This document describes an alternative technique, "Compact Denial of
   Existence" or "Compact Answers", to generate a signed DNS response on
   demand for a non-existent name by claiming that the name exists but
   has no resource records associated with the queried type, i.e. it
   returns a NODATA response rather than an NXDOMAIN response.  A NODATA
   response (which has a response code of NOERROR, and an empty ANSWER
   section) requires only one NSEC record matching the queried name.
   This has two advantages: the DNS response size is smaller, and it
   reduces the online cryptographic work involved in generating the
   response.

   The use of minimally covering NSEC records also prevents adversaries
   from enumerating the entire contents of DNS zones by walking NSEC
   chains.

2.  Distinguishing NXDOMAIN from Empty Non-Terminal Names

   Since NODATA responses are generated for non-existent names, and
   there are no defined record types for the name, the NSEC type bitmap
   in the response will only contain "NSEC" and "RRSIG".  Tools that
   need to accurately identify non-existent names in responses cannot
   rely on this specific type bitmap because Empty Non-Terminal (ENT)
   names (which positively exist) also have no record types at the name
   and will return exactly the same type bitmap.

   Today, some specific implementations of Compact Answers avoid the
   NXDOMAIN identification problem by synthesizing the NSEC type bitmap
   for ENTs to include all record types supported except for the queried
   type.  This has the undesirable effect of no longer being able to
   reliably determine the existence of ENTs, and of making the Type
   Bitmaps field potentially larger than it needs to be.  It also has
   the potential to confuse validators and others tools that infer type
   existence from the NSEC record.

   This document defines the use of a synthetic Resource Record type to
   signal the presence of a non-existent name.  The mnemonic for this RR
   type is "NXNAME" and its type code is [TBD].  This RR type is added
   to the NSEC type bitmap for responses to non-existent names (in
   addition to the required RRSIG and NSEC types).  The moniker NXNAME
   is chosen to clearly distinguish it from the response code NXDOMAIN.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC     October 2023


   No special handling of this RR type is required on the part of DNS
   resolvers.  However, a resolver could optionally use the presence of
   the RR type to modify the response code in the answer it relays back
   to downstream non-validating clients from NODATA to NXDOMAIN.

   An alternative way to distinguish NXDOMAIN from ENT is to define the
   synthetic Resource Record type for ENTs instead, as specified in
   [ENT-SENTINEL], and this has already been deployed in the field.
   This typically imposes less work on the server since NXDOMAIN
   responses are a lot more common than ENTs.  And at the time it was
   deployed it allowed a common bitmap pattern ("NSEC RRSIG") to
   identify NXDOMAIN across this and other implementations that returned
   a broad bitmap pattern for Empty Non-Terminals.  However, the
   advantage of the NXNAME RR type is that it explicitly identifies
   NXDOMAIN responses, and allows them to be distinguished conclusively
   from potential ENT responses in other online signing NSEC
   implementations.

3.  Generating Responses

   This section describes various types of answers generated by
   authoritative servers implementing Compact Denial of Existence.  At
   the current time, the compact denial scheme is only defined for NSEC.
   While it could support NSEC3 too, there is no benefit in introducing
   the additional complexity associated with it.

3.1.  Responses for Non-Existent Names

   When the authoritative server receives a query for a non-existent
   name in a zone that it serves, a NODATA response (response code
   NOERROR, empty Answer section) is generated with a dynamically
   constructed NSEC record with the owner name matching the queried name
   (QNAME).

   The Next Domain Name field SHOULD be set to the immediate
   lexicographic successor of the QNAME.  The Type Bit Maps field MUST
   only have the bits set for the following RR Types: RRSIG, NSEC, and
   NXNAME.

   For example, a request for the non-existing name a.example.com would
   cause the following NSEC record to be generated (in DNS presentation
   format):

          a.example.com. 3600 IN NSEC \000.a.example.com. RRSIG NSEC NXNAME

   The NSEC record MUST have corresponding RRSIGs generated.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC     October 2023


3.2.  Responses for Non-Existent Types

   When the authoritative server receives a query for a name that
   exists, but has no resource record sets associated with the queried
   type, it generates a NODATA response, with a dynamically constructed
   signed NSEC record in the Additional Section.  The owner name of the
   NSEC record matches the queried name.  The Next Domain Name field is
   set to the immediate lexicographic successor of the QNAME.  The Type
   Bitmaps field lists the available Resource Record types at the name.

   An Empty Non-Terminal is a special subset of this category, where the
   name has no resource record sets of any type (but has descendant
   names that do).  For a query for an Empty Non-Terminal, the NSEC type
   bitmap will only contain RRSIG and NSEC.  (Note that this is
   substantially different than the ENT response in precomputed NSEC,
   where the NSEC record has the same type bitmap, but "covers" rather
   than matches the ENT, and has the Next Domain Name field set to the
   next lexicographic descendent of the ENT in the zone.)

3.3.  Responses for Wildcard Matches

   For wildcard matches, the authoritative server will provide a
   dynamically signed response that claims that the queried name exists
   explicitly.  Specifically, the answer RR set will have an RRSIG
   record demonstrating an exact match (i.e. the label count in the
   RRSIG RDATA will be equal to the number of labels in the query name
   minus the root label).  This obviates the need to include an NSEC
   record in the Authority section of the response that shows that no
   closer match than the wildcard was possible.

   For a Wildcard NODATA match (where the queried name matches a
   wildcard but no data for the queried type exists), a response akin to
   a non-wildcard NODATA is returned.  The Answer section is empty, and
   the Additional section contains a single NSEC record that matches the
   query name with a type bitmap representing the list of types
   available at the wildcard.

3.4.  Responses to explicit queries for NXNAME

   NXNAME is a pseudo RR-type which should not appear anywhere in a DNS
   message apart from the NSEC type bitmap of a Compact Answer response
   as described previously in this document.  If however a DNS server
   implementing this specification receives an explicit query for the
   NXNAME RR type, this section describes what the response should be.

   If an explicit query for the NXNAME RR type is received for a domain
   name that does not exist, the server MUST omit the NXNAME RR type in
   the NSEC type bitmaps field and return only the types NSEC and RRSIG.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC     October 2023


   The reason for this is that if the NXNAME type were to be included, a
   validating resolver could treat the response as incoherent, fail to
   validate it, query other nameservers for the zone, before finally
   returning SERVFAIL to the querier.

   NXNAME queries for names that do exist require no special processing.
   A normal NODATA response is returned, indicating the actual types
   present at the name in the NSEC record.

4.  Operational Implications

   For DNSSEC enabled queries, a signed zone at an authoritative server
   implementing Compact Answers will never return a response with a
   response code of NXDOMAIN.  Tools that rely on accurately determining
   non-existent names will need to infer them from the presence of the
   NXNAME RR type in the type bitmap of the NSEC record in NODATA
   responses from these servers.  The response code in the DNS header
   cannot be authenticated, so inferring the status of a response from
   signed data in the body of the DNS message is more secure.

   Address lookup functions typically invoked by applications will
   continue to work, although extra invocations of these functions (and
   corresponding extra DNS queries) may be caused.  For example, a
   NODATA response to the lookup of an AAAA record for a non-existent
   name, can cause an application to issue another query at the same
   name for an A record.  Whereas a NXDOMAIN response to the first query
   would correctly suppress additional queries for other types at that
   name.  Address lookup functions could be enhanced to examine the NSEC
   type bitmaps in responses to accurately determine non-existent names,
   however they would need to issue DNSSEC enabled queries and
   potentially deal with middleboxes interfering with the delivery of
   DNSSEC signed responses.

5.  Response Code Restoration

   For non-existent names, implementations should try wherever possible,
   to preserve the response code value of 3 (NXDOMAIN).  This is
   generally possible for non-DNSSEC enabled queries, namely those which
   do not set the DNSSEC_OK EDNS flag.  For such queries, authoritative
   servers could return a normal NXDOMAIN response.  Additionally, a
   validating resolver that understands the NXNAME signal from an
   authoritative server could modify the response code from NOERROR to
   NXDOMAIN to downstream queriers that do not set the DNSSEC_OK flag.

5.1.  Signaled Response Code Restoration

   This section describes an optional but recommended scheme to permit
   signaled restoration of the NXDOMAIN RCODE for DNSSEC enabled
   responses.  A new EDNS0 [RFC6891] header flag is defined in the 2nd
   most significant bit of the flags field in the EDNS0 OPT header.
   This flag is referred to as the "Compact Answers OK (CO)" flag.

                   +0 (MSB)                +1 (LSB)
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         0: |   EXTENDED-RCODE      |       VERSION         |
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         2: |DO|CO|                 Z                       |
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   When this flag is sent in a query by a resolver, it indicates that
   the resolver will accept a signed NXNAME enhanced NODATA response for
   a non-existent name together with the response code field set to
   NXDOMAIN (3).

   In responses to such queries, a Compact Denial authoritative
   implementing this signaling scheme, will set the Compact Answers OK
   EDNS header flag, and for non-existent names will additionally set
   the response code field to NXDOMAIN.

   EDNS is a hop by hop signal, so resolvers will need to record the
   presence of this flag in associated cache data and respond to
   downstream DNSSEC enabled queriers appropriately.  If the querier
   does not set the Compact Answers OK flag, the resolver will need to
   reset the response code back to NOERROR (0) for an NXNAME response.

6.  Implementation Status

   Cloudflare, NS1, and Amazon Route53 currently implement the base
   Compact Answers scheme.  NS1 implements the Empty Non-Terminal
   distinguisher using the private RR type code 65281.  Cloudflare
   implements the NXNAME distinguisher using the private RR type code
   65283.  There are no implementations yet of the signaled rcode
   substitution scheme.

7.  Security Considerations

   Online signing of DNS records requires authoritative servers for the
   DNS zone to have access to the private signing keys.  Exposing
   signing keys on Internet reachable servers makes them more vulnerable
   to attack.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC     October 2023


   Additionally, generating signatures on-demand is more computationally
   intensive than returning pre-computed signatures.  Although the
   Compact Answers scheme reduces the number of online signing
   operations compared to previous techniques like White Lies, it still
   may make authoritative servers more vulnerable to computational
   denial of service attacks than pre-computed signatures.  The use of
   signature algorithms (like those based on Elliptic Curves) that have
   a comparatively low cost for signing is recommended.

8.  Acknowledgements

   The Compact Answers technique (then called "Black Lies") was
   originally proposed in [BLACK-LIES] by F.  Valsorda and O.
   Gudmundsson, and implemented by Cloudflare.  The Empty Non-Terminal
   distinguisher RR type was originally proposed in [ENT-SENTINEL] by S.
   Huque.  The NXNAME type is based on the FDOM type proposed in
   [NXDOMAIN-TYPE] by O.  Gudmundsson and F.  Valsorda.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new DNS Resource Record type code for
   NXNAME in the DNS parameters registry, from the meta type range.

         NXNAME  [TBD]  NXDOMAIN Distinguisher for Compact Denial of Existence

   IANA is additionally requested to allocate the "Compact Answers OK"
   flag in the EDNS header, as described in Section 5.1
